Task:
Given a larger and a smaller template image, I have to write a complete Evolutionary
algorithm that takes the two images and solves the template matching problem, i.e.
finds the coordinates or location of the smaller image within the larger image.

The complete evolutionary algorithm code is provided in the AI_image_processing.py file.
